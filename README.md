# Data of Driving Patterns for Electric Vehicles (EVs) üöó

## Goals üèÜ

The aim of this repository is to provide the details of the EV driving patterns data set used in papers [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00787) and [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07021). This article have been developed by some members of the [OASYS group](https://sites.google.com/view/groupoasys/home) thanks to the funding of the project [Flexanalytics](https://groupoasysflexanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We suggest you to visit the related links to know more our research üòâ

## Contents üé™

This repository includes the data about the driving patterns of an EV-fleet for one year. This data set contains the availability profiles and the energy required for transportation of EVs, which are synthetically derived from the data collected by the [National Household Travel Survey](https://nhts.ornl.gov/). This EV-fleet is made up of 1000 EVs. Each data file is explained below: 

- Availability: The availability profiles show in which time periods the EV is available (the value is 1), to charge or discharge, and unavailable (the value is 0). The following files of availability can be downloaded:

    * [Data_a_24_1000](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZLeopKk0zuBNjB3ujzY-_40QiXz4DdRS/view?usp=sharing): The time period is 1 hour.
    
    * [Data_a_48_1000](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10uMwUzHm2YRvnNHqr7O7Q2Sk3_N4hlgm/view?usp=sharing): The time period is 30 minutes.
    
    * [Data_a_96_1000](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18yZ81ROMQDjKkjd8qmMyzdU70nYbM62B/view?usp=sharing): The time period is 15 minutes.
    
- EV demand: This data includes the distance travelled per EV each day. This data is found in the following file:
